| Few-Shot Prompting  | [举例子](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot) | - This is awesome! // Negative</br>- This is bad! // Positive</br>- Wow, that movie was rad! // Positive</br>- What a horrible show! //  |
| [Chain-of-Thought Prompting](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot) `思维链（CoT）` | prompt with a statement or question, and then generating a response or continuation based on that prompt. | ![CoT Example](https://www.promptingguide.ai/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcot.1933d9fe.png&w=1920&q=75)
| [Self-Consistency](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/consistency) 自我一致性 | 取代`思维链（CoT）`提示中使用的naive greedy decoding(天真贪婪解码)。其理念是通过少次CoT对多种不同的推理路径进行采样，并利用各代推理选择最一致的答案。这有助于提高 CoT 提示在涉及算术和常识推理任务中的性能。| Prompt: When I was 6 my sister was half my age. Now I’m 70 how old is my sister? Output: 35 答案错误
[ReAct (Reason + Act)](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/react) | 以交错的方式生成推理跟踪和特定任务的行动。生成推理轨迹允许模型诱导、跟踪和更新行动计划，甚至处理异常。行动步骤允许与外部来源（如知识库或环境）连接并收集信息，还能提高 LLM 的人工可解释性和可信度。总之，作者发现最好的方法是将 ReAct 与思维链（CoT）相结合，这样就能在推理过程中同时使用内部知识和外部信息。ReAct受到人类在学习新任务、做决策或推理时“表演”和“推理”之间的协同作用启发，它是一种将推理和行为结合起来的通用范式，通过激发语言模型生成口头推理过程和任务行为，实现动态推理以制定、维护和调整行动计划，并能够与外部环境（例如维基百科）进行交互，将额外信息纳入推理过程，从而解决`思维链（CoT）`提示的局限性，如缺乏对外部世界的访问或无法更新知识而导致的事实虚构和错误传播问题。| ![react example](https://www.promptingguide.ai/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freact.8e7c93ae.png&w=1920&q=75)
